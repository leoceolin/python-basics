# Generator Examples with Jupyter Notebooks

This project contains a collection of Python code examples demonstrating how to work with **generators** and the `yield` keyword.  
To make execution and testing easier, all examples are provided as **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) files.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ An interactive environment for writing, running, and testing Python code.

## How It Works
Each `.ipynb` file contains self-contained code examples explaining and demonstrating generator concepts in Python, including:
- How to create generators using `yield`.
- The difference between `return` and `yield`.
- Practical use cases for generators, such as producing values lazily, processing large datasets, and creating infinite sequences.

You can open and run them directly in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment such as [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Running the Examples
To open and run a notebook locally:

```bash
jupyter notebook name_of_file.ipynb
