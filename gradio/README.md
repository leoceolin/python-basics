# Gradio Interfaces

This project contains a collection of Python scripts that use [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) to create simple and interactive web-based interfaces.

## Technologies Used
- **Gradio** â€“ A Python library for quickly building and sharing web UIs for machine learning models or any Python function.

## How It Works
Each file inside the `gradio` folder defines a standalone Gradio interface.  
To run any of them, execute:

```bash
python name_of_file.py
